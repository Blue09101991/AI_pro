Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of your red and swollen eye. It is possible that you may be suffering from conjunctivitis, which is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin, transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. Symptoms of conjunctivitis include redness, swelling, itching, burning, and discharge. Treatment for conjunctivitis typically involves the use of artificial tears, cold compresses, and anti-inflammatory medications. If the symptoms persist or worsen, it is recommended that you seek medical attention from an ophthalmologist.",,,2023-06-28 22:35:43.747718
